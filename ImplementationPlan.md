   - Create authentication pages and logic using Supabase Auth.

3. **Basic UI Setup**
   - Design a simple UI using Next.js pages and components.
   - Implement Zustand for global state management.

### Week 2: Video Upload and Processing
1. **Video Upload Page**
   - Create a video upload page using Uppy for file uploads.
   - Implement client-side video processing with FFmpeg.wasm for trimming and filtering.

2. **Direct Upload to Cloudflare R2**
   - Set up Cloudflare R2 for media storage.
   - Implement direct upload functionality using presigned URLs.

3. **Video Playback**
   - Integrate HLS.js for adaptive video streaming.
   - Set up a basic video player using Video.js.

## Phase 2: Backend and API Development (Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3: API and Database
1. **Set Up Backend with NestJS**
   - Initialize a NestJS project for the backend.
   - Implement GraphQL Federation with Apollo Router for API endpoints.

2. **Database Integration**
   - Set up PostgreSQL with Supabase for main database operations.
   - Implement Redis for caching and session management.

3. **Real-time Features**
   - Integrate Socket.IO for real-time features like comments and reactions.

### Week 4: Media Processing and Optimization
1. **Media Processing Pipeline**
   - Implement a media processing pipeline using Cloudflare Workers and WASM for transcoding.
   - Set up Cloudflare Stream for video streaming.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use Partytown for offloading third-party scripts.
   - Optimize builds with TurboPack and React Forget.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and Scalability (Weeks 5-6)

### Week 5: Social Features and Analytics
